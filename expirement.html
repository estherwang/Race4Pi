<font size="+1">Since ancient civilizations, the constant pi has been recognized for its great importance because of its direct relationship to circles. <br/>
The accuracy of pi has long been needed for practical reasons. Many ethnic groups in the past have tried to express pi as a fraction. <br/>
But, because it is an irrational number, these fractions could only be vague estimations. <br/>
However, in the 16th and 17th century, the calculation of pi was revolutionized by the development of infinite series, <br/>
the sum or product of terms in an infinite sequence. <br/>
This allowed mathematicians to calculate pi with much more precision than the traditional geometric techniques. <br/>
Infinite series were mostly exploited by European mathematicians, although records show that the first approach was discovered in India <br/>
by astronomer Nilakantha Somayaji. As mathematics developed, so did the series for calculating pi. <br/>
They became refined, particularly in the area of efficiency. <br/>
Here, we have three examples of infinite series for pi. Take a look and see: which one is the most accurate after a given amount of time?<br/></font>

<div id="dialog" title="Leonhard Euler">

  <p><img src="eulerquote.jpg" style="width: 250">Leonhard Euler was born on April 15th, 1707 in Basal, Switzerland. Euler was born into a family that originally planned to have him enter into a career as a clergyman. However, even at a young age, he began to display talent for mathematics. As a result, he attended the University of Basal and finished his masters degree while still in his teens. After serving in the Navy, Euler became a professor of physics at the St. Petersburg academy and later joined the mathematics division. Here, he released hundreds of articles, contributing greatly to fields of geometry, trigonometry and calculus. He died in September, 1783 at the age of 76. </p>

<div id="dialog2" title= "John Wallis">
	<p><img src="wallis quote.jpg" style="width: 250">John Wallis was born on November 23, 1616 in Ashford, England. He attended to University of Cambridge and was ordained a priest in 1640. Shortly after, he showed his aptitude for mathematics when he deciphered several cryptic messages. In 1649, Wallis was appointed as professor of geometry at the university of Oxford, which marked the beginning of a period of mathematical research that went on until his death in 1703. Wallis made significant contributions to the use of exponents, especially negative and fractional exponents, the use of algebra on traditionally geometric problems and calculus. He was the most prominent English mathematician until Isaac Newton.  </p>

<div id="dialog3" title="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz">
	<p><img src="leibnizquotes.jpg" style="width: 250">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born on July 1, 1646. He was a German polymath and philosopher who developed differential and integral calculus independently of Isaac Newton. Leibniz's notation has been widely used ever since it was published. Leibniz also was the first to describe the pinwheel calculator and later invented the Leibniz wheel. He also refined the binary system, the foundation of all digital computers. Leibniz is now regarded as one of the creators of calculus as well as someone who made great breakthroughs in the area of mechanizing calculations. He died on November 14, 1716. </p>
